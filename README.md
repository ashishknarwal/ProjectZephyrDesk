The Support Ticket Management System is a Model Driven App designed to streamline and automate the process of managing customer support tickets within an organization. It provides a centralized platform for efficiently tracking, prioritizing, and resolving customer issues, ensuring timely and satisfactory resolutions.

Built as a Model Driven App, this project leverages the power of the Microsoft Power Platform to deliver a robust and customizable solution. By utilizing the platform's rich set of tools and features, the Support Ticket Management System offers a user-friendly interface and seamless integration with other Microsoft applications, such as Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Teams.

The primary objective of this project is to simplify the support ticket management process, allowing support teams to effectively handle customer queries, incidents, and requests. The system facilitates the creation of tickets, assignment to the appropriate support agents, tracking ticket status, and capturing relevant details for each interaction.

Key Features of the Support Ticket Management System:
- Ticket creation: Users can easily create support tickets, providing necessary details such as customer information, issue description, and priority level.
- Ticket assignment and routing: It empowers managers to manually assign tickets to the most suitable support agents based on their expertise and experience. The system provides managers with an intuitive interface to assess the nature of the ticket and allocate it to the agent who is best equipped to handle the task at hand. This manual assignment process ensures that each ticket is directed to the appropriate agent, taking into consideration their knowledge, skills, and workload, thereby optimizing the ticket resolution process.
- Ticket tracking: Support agents can track the status of each ticket throughout its lifecycle, from initial creation to resolution, enabling effective monitoring and proactive follow-ups.
- Communication and collaboration: The system promotes seamless communication and collaboration among support agents, allowing them to exchange updates, share knowledge, and seek assistance within the platform.
- Reporting and analytics: Comprehensive reporting and analytics capabilities provide insights into support ticket trends, agent performance, and customer satisfaction, enabling data-driven decision-making.

This project embraces the principles of flexibility and extensibility, empowering organizations to customize the Support Ticket Management System to align with their unique business requirements. The Model Driven App approach facilitates easy configuration and customization of forms, workflows, and business rules, without the need for extensive coding.

With its user-friendly interface, robust functionality, and integration capabilities, the Support Ticket Management System offers a scalable solution that can benefit organizations of all sizes, ranging from small businesses to large enterprises.
